**Chapter 01 What is functional programming?**

We construct our programs using only *pure functions*, functions that have no *side effects*. What are side effects? A function has a side effect if it does something other rthan simply return a result, for example:
- Modifying a variable
- Modifying a data structure in place
- Setting a field on an object
- Throwing an exception or halting with an error
- Printing to the console or reading user input
- Reading from or writing to a file
- Drawing on the screen

In this chapter, we'll look at a simple program with side effects and demonstrate some of the benefits of FP by removing these side effects. We also discuss the benefits of FP more generally and define two important concepts -- *referential transparency* and *substitution model*.

# The benefits of FP: a simple example
## A program with side effects

A Scala program with side effects:

``` scala
class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): Coffee = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    cc.charge(cup.price)
    cup
  }
}
```

The line `cc.charge(cup.price)` is an example of a side effect. Charging a credit card involves some interaction with the outside world -- suppose it requires contacting the credit card company via some web service, authorizing the transaction, charging the card, and (if successful) presisting some recore of the transaction for later reference. But our function merely returns a `Coffee` and these other actions are happening on the side, hence the term “side effect.” (Again, we’ll define side effects more formally later in this chapter.)

We can make the code more modular and testable by letting `CreditCard` be ignorant of these concerns and passing a Payments object into `buyCoffee`.

Adding a payments object:

``` scala
class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard, p: Payments): Coffee = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    cc.charge(cc, cup.price)
    cup
  }
}
```

Though side effects still occur when we call `p.charge(cc, cup.price)`, we have at least regained some testability.

## A functional solution: removing the side effects

``` scala
class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: Creditcard): (Coffee, Charge) = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    (cup, Charge(cc, cup.price))
  }
}
```

# Exactly what is a (pure) function?
# Referential transparency, purity, and the substitution model
